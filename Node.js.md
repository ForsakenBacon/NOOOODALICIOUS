<p>Node Package Managers (NPMs) are a neat part of node.js. NPMs are a set of publicly available, reusable components, available through easy installation via an online repository, with version and dependency management. What this means is that if you need to make a piece of code to perform a certain task, there&#39;s most likely somebody else out there who&#39;s already made said code and published it to the module ecosystem. All of these modules are accessible via the <a href="https://npmjs.org/">https://npmjs.org/</a> website, and can be installed at your leisure.</p>
<p>Some examples of popular modules include...</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Express</em> - a Sinatra-inspired web development framework for Node.js, and the de-facto standard for the majority of Node.js applications out there today.</li>
<li><em>Socket.io and sockjs</em> - Server-side component of the two most common websockets components out there today.</li>
</ol>
